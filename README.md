# project-e2e-automated-tests

It is a framework (e2e) which automates testing of an online shop (http://automationpractice.com/index.php) using Java code (Maven, PageObject pattern) and Selenium.
I created this project for my Java and Selenium learning. Due to that it contains a lot of private notes and comments which helps me in the process.
Goal of the project is to create a fully functional testing framework and learn as much as possible in the meantime.
